UNFUN's Code Learning Project

## Project Overview
This is a project focused on learning data science. Through practice and exploration, we will learn core concepts and skills in data processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Learning Objectives
- Master Python data science libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Learn data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Understand data visualization principles and practices
- Master basic statistical analysis methods
- Learn fundamental machine learning algorithms and applications

## Environment Setup
1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone [project-url]
cd [project-directory]
